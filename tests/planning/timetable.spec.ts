/*
 * The timetable, through the interface.
 *
 * WHAT IS WORTH A BROWSER HERE
 *
 * Not "the grid renders". The properties below are the ones that would be a
 * real bug and that nothing else would catch: a wizard that reappears over a
 * teacher's real timetable, a second lesson silently duplicating a slot, a
 * deleted resource taking the lesson down with it, and Today quietly writing to
 * a week it is only supposed to read.
 *
 * There are no data-testid attributes anywhere in this app, so every selector
 * here is a role, a label or an aria-label exactly as the component spells it.
 *
 * WHICH DAY A LESSON HAS TO GO ON, which is the fiddly part
 *
 * Both screens read the CURRENT week and nothing else. The timetable resolves it
 * from the browser clock on mount and offers no URL parameter; TodayView calls
 * listWeek(mondayOf(now)) the same way. So a lesson seeded into next week is
 * invisible to both, and every test here seeds the current week.
 *
 * Today additionally drops days that have already been and gone, so a Monday
 * lesson is invisible on the dashboard from Tuesday onwards. Anything asserting
 * what Today SHOWS therefore seeds a day that has not passed yet, worked out
 * from the clock rather than hardcoded: see upcomingDay() below.
 */

/**
 * A weekday in the current week that Today will still show.
 *
 * isPastDay compares dates with a strict `<`, so TODAY itself still counts and
 * the honest answer on a weekday is simply today. At the weekend mondayOf()
 * still returns the week just gone, every day of which is behind us, so there is
 * no such day at all and the caller must skip.

 * looks exactly like a broken save rather than a test that arrived early.
