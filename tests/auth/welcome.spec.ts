/*
 * The welcome screen a new teacher lands on after signing up.
 *
 * The interesting property is not that the page renders, it is that it renders
 * ONCE, for a new account, and never gets in the way afterwards. Nothing is
 * stored to mark it seen: it works purely because /complete-profile is the one
 * screen both signup paths pass through and signing in does not. That is easy
 * to break by "tidying" a redirect, and nothing else would notice, so these
 * pin both halves.
 *
 * The full signup form is not driven here. createTeacher already seeds the
 * profile /complete-profile would have written, so a test that filled the form
 * again would be testing the form, not this. The redirect itself is asserted
 * where it lives, against the page's own source, in the last test.
