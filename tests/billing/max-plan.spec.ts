/*
 * Max plan: the surfaces a teacher sees.
 *
 * Covers the three things that were broken or missing when Max went back on
 * sale:
 *   1. A free teacher could not see Max anywhere in the app — the subscription
 *      section offered a link to /pricing, which sold only Pro.
 *   2. A Pro subscriber had no way to reach Max at all.
 *   3. The sidebar offered "Top up credits" at any balance, and the modal it
 *      opened navigated to a page whose top-up button only appears above 80%
 *      used — so anyone below that hit a dead end.
 *
 * Deliberately stops at the point money would change hands: these assert what
 * is offered and where the buttons lead, not Stripe's own checkout, which is
 * not ours to drive.
