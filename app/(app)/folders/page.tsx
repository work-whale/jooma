/*
 * Library.
 *
 * Folders are real rows the teacher creates, names and colours (see
 * app/lib/folders.ts and supabase/migrations/20260902000000_folders.sql). A
 * resource sits in at most one, and `folder_id IS NULL` is the permanent
 * Unfiled card rather than an absence of state.
 *
 * This replaced a version that derived one folder per tool from
 * tool_runs.tool_slug. That grouping was not wrong, it was just not a folder:
 * nothing could be created, renamed or moved, so every affordance the prototype
 * specifies had to be left out.
 *
 * Filing is drag and drop, as the prototype has it, AND a Move to folder item
 * in the row menu. The menu is not a fallback for a browser that cannot drag:
 * it is the only route that works with a keyboard, and dragging alone would put
 * the whole feature out of reach.
 *
 * Upload is deliberately absent. The prototype has an Upload button and a drop
 * zone for Word, PowerPoint, PDF and images; that is file storage, with its own
 * quota, scanning and retention questions, and it is a separate piece of work.
 */

/*
 * Three views that are not folders.
 *
 * The default (no selection) is the unfiled pile: folder_id IS NULL, what still
 * needs sorting. That is the useful thing to land on, because it is the only
 * view with anything to do in it, and it empties as the teacher files.
 *
 * ALL is a card in the grid rather than the default, so "show me everything"
 * stays one click away without being what you stare at every visit.
 *
 * None is a row in `folders`. ALL and Unfiled are views over
 * tool_runs.folder_id; SHARED is something different again, below.
 */

/*
 * SHARED IS A FILTER, NOT A FOLDER, and the distinction is the whole design.
 *
 * It holds the resources that arrived from a colleague and were added: the runs
 * whose ids appear as shares.saved_run_id (see indexBySavedRun). So membership
 * is PROVENANCE, which is a fact about where a resource came from, and filing
 * is a CHOICE about where the teacher keeps it. Those are independent, so:
 *
 *   - a shared resource can sit in "Shared with me" AND in Autumn 2 at once;
 *   - filing one moves it out of Unfiled and leaves it here, because being
 *     filed does not make it stop having come from Alice;
 *   - nothing can be dropped ONTO it, because you cannot make a resource
 *     shared by dragging it.
 *
 * The consequence to expect: the card counts no longer sum to the total, unlike
 * ALL / Unfiled / folders, which partition. That is correct for an overlapping
 * view and is not a bug to be fixed by making membership exclusive.
