/*
 * Edit the rows of the week.
 *
 * The period list was captured once by the setup wizard and then unreachable
 * forever: a teacher who mistyped a time, whose school changed its day, or who
 * simply calls the row "Period 2" had no way back to it. This is that way back,
 * and it is the same interaction as the wizard's step one rather than a second
 * idea about how periods are edited.
 *
 * A LABEL IS FREE TEXT, NOT A TIME. The migration is explicit that these are
 * labels: "9:00" is merely the default, and "Period 2", "Form time" or "AM" are
 * all equally valid. Blank is valid too and falls back to the default, which is
 * what periodLabel() decides.
 *
 * Removing a row that still has lessons in it is a conversation, not a refusal.
 * The migration deliberately leaves `period` unconstrained against this array's
 * length precisely so the client can ask rather than fail, so the count is shown
 * and confirmed before anything is deleted.
