 * One plan, as a card. Shared by the landing page, /welcome and the profile's
 * subscription section.
 *
 * PRESENTATIONAL ONLY — it fetches nothing and knows nothing about Stripe. The
 * three callers have genuinely different jobs (checkout, checkout-after-claim,
 * and plan changes on an existing subscription), so each supplies its own
 * handler and its own label. What they share is the look, and that is all this
 * owns.
 *
 * Not a client component: it has no state and no effects. A caller that needs
 * interactivity is already a client component and can render this inside itself.
