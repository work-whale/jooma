// ── Editable site copy ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The read half of /admin/copy. The admin panel has always been able to edit,
// draft, publish and roll back copy blocks; nothing read them, so publishing
// changed a row in the database and nothing else. This is what makes the page
// mean something.
//
// Two rules shape everything here:
//
//   1. Read `public_copy`, never `copy_blocks`. The view filters to
//      `live and value is not null`, which is what keeps an unpublished draft
//      off the marketing site. RLS is row-level, not column-level, so the view
//      is the mechanism.
//
//   2. A missing value is never a blank page. Every key has a code default, and
//      an unpublished key, an empty string or a database that is down all fall
//      through to it. Copy is decoration; it must not be able to take the
//      landing page down.
