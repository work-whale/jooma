/*
 * Every plan a teacher can be on, and the way to get to each one.
 *
 * WHY ALL OF THEM, ALWAYS
 * This used to render only for people with NO subscription, and only the plans
 * above them — so a subscriber saw a single "Upgrade" button and a Max
 * subscriber saw nothing at all. Moving down was invisible: the only route off
 * Max was the red Cancel button, which reads as quitting rather than switching.
 * Showing the full ladder with the current rung marked makes every move
 * available in the same place, in both directions.
 *
 * The figures are derived — PLANS for the price, planCredits() via
 * planFeatures() for the allowance — so a card cannot advertise something the
 * ceiling will not honour. See the note above PENCE_PER_CREDIT in lib/plans.ts.
 *
 * The ACTIONS are all existing components. This decides which one belongs on
 * which card; each still owns its own confirmation and its own request.
