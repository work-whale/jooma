 * "What you'd miss out on" — the honest half of a downgrade confirmation.
 *
 * Shown before any plan move DOWN, whether that is Max to Pro or cancelling
 * altogether. One component for both, so there is a single retention surface rather
 * than two that drift.
 *
 * The lines are DERIVED from PLANS[].limits by planLosses(), never written out
 * here. That matters more than usual at this particular moment: this text is
 * read by someone deciding whether to leave, so a stale hand-kept list would
 * either undersell the loss (costing a save we could have made) or oversell it
 * (claiming they lose something they keep — which they will notice, and which
 * is the kind of thing that turns a downgrade into a cancellation).
 *
 * Visually the inverse of the plan card's tick list: same rows, muted crosses
 * instead of purple ticks.
