/*
 * The plan choice on the first screen a new teacher sees, with "Got a code?"
 * above it.
 *
 * There is no free plan, so choosing one is the signup's last step: every card
 * starts a Stripe checkout with the free trial, where the card is taken and
 * nothing is charged until the trial ends.
 *
 * Two separate things happen around a code, and keeping them apart is the
 * point:
 *
 *   CLAIMING records who referred this teacher. It happens once, immediately,
 *   and never expires. Even if they leave checkout without subscribing, the
 *   ambassador gets the credit.
 *
 *   The DISCOUNT is Stripe's, and is applied at checkout from the claim. So
 *   somebody can take a code today, leave, and subscribe next month with the
 *   discount still waiting for them. Nothing has to be retyped, and the code
 *   does not have to be remembered.
 *
 * This component therefore never grants anything. It calls two server routes
 * that do all the deciding, because a client that could name its own plan or
 * discount would be a self-service upgrade.
