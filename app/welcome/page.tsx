/*
 * The first screen a new teacher sees.
 *
 * Reached once, from the end of /complete-profile, which both the email and the
 * Google signup paths pass through. Signing in goes straight to /tools, so this
 * is not a screen anyone has to dismiss twice. Nothing is persisted to mark it
 * seen: it is a one-shot redirect target, not a flag on the profile.
 *
 * It sits outside the (app) route group deliberately, so it inherits the bare
 * root layout rather than the signed-in shell, the same way every other page in
 * the signup funnel opts out. That means SquircleDefs has to be mounted here:
 * `clip-path: url(#jsq)` resolves against the current document, and without it
 * every tool tile renders as an unclipped square.
