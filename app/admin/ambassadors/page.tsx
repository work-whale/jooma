 * Who brought each teacher in, and who is owed for it.

 * Two sources, deliberately. The ATTRIBUTION is ours: which teacher redeemed
 * whose code, when they first paid, and whether that payout has been settled.
 * The OFFER is Stripe's, read live for the same reason /admin/promos does it —
 * Stripe validates the code at checkout, so a local copy of the discount would
 * be a second truth that can disagree with the one the customer meets.
 *
 * A Stripe outage costs the offer text and nothing else. The payout table, which
 * is the part with money attached, is answered entirely from our own database.
